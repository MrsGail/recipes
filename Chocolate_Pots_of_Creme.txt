Pioneer Woman One Blender Chocolate Pots of Creme

Prep time: 15 mins
Chilling in Refrig time: at least 4 hours
Servings: 2

Serving containers: Martini glasses, champagne flutes, bourbon nose sniffers,
	other small	vessels for 3-4 ounce serving 

Ingredients:
	12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips
	4 eggs (at room temperature)
	2 tsp Vanilla extract or favorite single barrel bourbon
		or favorite cognac or kahlua or whatever you like 
	Pinch of salt
	8 ounces very hot, very strong coffee (can be decafe or high test but must
		be hot like McDonald's law suit hot)
	whipped cream (store bought or homemade)

Pull blender out of cupboard, plug it in (dust off and wipe down if needed).
Throw 12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips into blender.  
Crack the 4 eggs into the blender (throw away the egg shells).
Measure and add single barrel bourbon (or vanilla or cognac...) into blender.
Add pinch of salt to blender.
Put blender lid on the blender.
Turn on blender to blend/mix setting.  
Watch it start to blend and when it looks blended (can't see whole chocolate
	chips or egg yellow anymore, looks to be one consistent color), remove that circular disk in the top of the blender.
Slowly, slowly pour in the hot coffee through the hole in the lid (drizzle
	it in at one time) while continuing to blend, and the mixture will expand and rise in the blender.
After all the coffee is in the blender, continue blending until smooth.
Turn off blender.
Pour into serving vessels, leave room for whipped cream on top later.
Chill in refrigerator at least 4 hours.
Before serving, pull out of refrig and top with whipped cream.
